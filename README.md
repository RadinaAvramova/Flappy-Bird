## AI Flappy Bird Player
Welcome to the AI Flappy Bird Player project! This Python script implements an artificial intelligence (AI) agent that plays the popular Flappy Bird game. The AI Flappy Bird Player utilizes machine learning techniques, specifically neural networks and genetic algorithms, to train an AI agent to navigate through the game environment and achieve high scores.

## How it Works
1. **Game Environment:** The script simulates the Flappy Bird game environment, including the bird, pipes, and obstacles.

2. **Neural Network:** The AI agent is controlled by a neural network that receives inputs from the game environment (e.g., bird's position, distance to obstacles) and outputs actions (e.g., flap or don't flap).

3. **Training:** The AI agent is trained using a genetic algorithm, which evolves a population of neural networks over multiple generations. Each generation plays the game, and the fittest individuals (i.e., those that achieve the highest scores) are selected for reproduction, crossover, and mutation to create the next generation.

4. **Evaluation:** The performance of each neural network is evaluated based on its ability to play the game and achieve high scores. Fitness functions are used to assess performance and guide the evolutionary process.

5. **Testing:** Once training is complete, the best-performing neural network is selected as the final AI agent, capable of playing Flappy Bird autonomously and achieving high scores.

## Usage
1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/your_username/Flappy-Bird.git

2. **Navigate to the Directory:** Change your current directory to the location of the cloned repository:

cd Flappy-Bird

2. **Run the Script:** Run the Python script to start training the AI agent to play Flappy Bird:

python flappy_bird.py

3. **Monitor Training:** Watch as the AI agent learns to play Flappy Bird through multiple generations of training. You can observe the progress and performance of the AI agent in real-time.

4. **Testing:** After training is complete, the best-performing AI agent will be saved. You can then run the script again to test the AI agent's performance in playing Flappy Bird autonomously.

## Customization
1. **Neural Network Architecture:** Customize the architecture of the neural network by adjusting the number of layers, neurons per layer, activation functions, and other parameters.

2. **Training Parameters:** Adjust training parameters such as population size, mutation rate, crossover rate, and number of generations to optimize training performance and achieve better results.

3. **Game Environment:** Modify the game environment settings, such as screen size, pipe speed, gravity, and bird physics, to create different challenges for the AI agent.
